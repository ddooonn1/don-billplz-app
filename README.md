# BillPlz Application - Laravel Project

## Overview

This project is a part of my application to BillPlz. It consists of two main features: a Password Generator and a Pizza Ordering System, both implemented using the Laravel framework.

### Password Generator (Q1)

The Password Generator generates strong, random passwords based on specified criteria such as length and character types. Users can customize the length of the password and choose which character types to include, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

### Pizza Ordering System (Q2)

The Pizza Ordering System allows users to place orders for pizzas. Users can select the size of the pizza and choose additional toppings such as pepperoni or extra cheese. The system calculates the total bill based on the orders placed.
